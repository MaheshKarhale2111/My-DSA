1.Backtracking vs Recursion vs Dp 
2. Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution
    incrementally. Solving one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the 
    constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree) is the process of backtracking.
