1. Check binary addition and subtraction 
    1+1 = 10 , 1+1+1 = 11 
2. subtracing in binary equivalent to adding inverse 
    12-5 == 12+ (-5) 
    for finding inverse we use 2's complement method 
3. 2's complement - invert all bits and add 1 
4. note that while inverting - all bits before actual number are acully 0 so after invering it becomes 1 
5. & is a bitwise operator and compares each operand bitwise.
    It is a binary AND Operator and copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
    Assume integer variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13 then  
    (A & B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100.
    Whereas && is a logical AND operator and operates on boolean operands. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true otherwise it is false. Assume boolean variable A holds true and variable B holds false then (A && B) is false.
    & is to be used during bitwise operations and && is useful during logical operations.
6. Xor (^) - when both bits are different then it is 1 otherwise 0 
7. The ~ (bitwise NOT) takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
8. The << (left shift) takes two numbers, the left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
9. The >> (right shift) takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
10. the right shifing by 1 is equivalent to dividing number by 2 
    10 >> 1 -> 1010 >> 1 -> 0101 = 5 
11. How to check even odd - > the last bit of even is 1 and for odd it's zero 
    make sense as other bits only gives power of 2's which adds up to even number only 
    so the last bit which is equivalent to '1' decides it's off or even 
12. bit masking to find odd even 
    if(a&1 == 0) -> odd 
    if(a&1 == 1) -> even 
13. To swap two numbers a and b-
    a = a ^ b ; 
    b = a ^ b ; 
    a = a ^ b ;

1. Bitmasking - imposing mask over the bits. to keep, change, or remove a desired part of information 
2. use of bitmasking - In computer graphics, bitmasking is used to alter pixels and run various operations on images.- insta filters 
3. Bitmasking increases code complexity and decreases the ease of read . 
4. Find , set and clear ith bit - watch anuj bhaiys's second video 
5. number of bits in binary representation of number = log2n + 1 


5. Find number of bits to change to convert from a to b 
    concept 1 : The xor operator only activates when two bits are different 
        eq. 9 and 3 - 1001 and 0101 -> so 9^3 -> 1111 - > now we have to find number of 1's in this ans 
    concept 2 :  number we have is 1111 -> right shift the number till it becomes 0 
        and while right shifing check if it's odd or even means uska last bit 1 hai ya 0 hai and count++
        this loop run for log2n + 1 times 
    better approach : 
        if given number is n then find n & (n-1) till it becomes '0' 
        this one operation make the last significant set bit = 0 
        so this loop will run for number of set bits in binary representation 
        set bit is basically '1'

Advance bit manipulation 

1. a^a = 0
2. 0^a  = a

Q. find the only non repeating element in array where every element repeats twice 
   we know xor of number with itself equals zero. so if we do combined xor of all elements in array 
   all other elements with pairs will cancel each other givning zero except one single element remains which will be our ans
