1. << Is called Insertion operator.
2.>> Extraction operator
3.PS E:\CODING\K.MAHESH C++> g++ .\tut5.cpp
PS E:\CODING\K.MAHESH C++> .\a.exe
to run terminal
4.Open header file by ctrl + click
5. Alt + arrows to shift rows
6.\n and <<endl used to brake lines
7. To print gobal variable <<::c
c is global variable lecture #7
8. By default any decimal numbr is double 
eg. 34.4 is considered as double by compiler 
but if we have to pass it as a float...     make number like 34.4f.
same for 34.4l for long double lecture #7 even we can use 34.4F and 34.4L 
9.typecasting 
float(a) is same as (float)a
# lecture 8
to assign a fix value we use const int a =3
setw operator and endl are commonly used manipulators in c++
operator precednce cppreference.com..... dont apply bodmas rule2
#lecture#13
pointer arithmetic 
address new = address old + i*sizeof deta type
where address new is p+i
          address continue is i
in case of pointers and arrays we dont use & to get address 
main(){
    int marks [4] = {21, 23, 56, 67};
    int* p= marks;
here using &marks is wrong

1. Structures used to store different types of datas.
unlike arrays which is used to store same kind of data.
we can use typedef struct employee{} ep;
this means where we were using struct employee we can use simple ep.
we can chose any instead of ep.

Common mistake in coding 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b,sum, minus;
    
    sum = a + b;
    minus = a - b;
    
    cout << "Enter value of a" << endl;
    cin >> a;
    cout << "Enter value of b" << endl;
    cin >> b;

    cout << "sum is " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Subtraction is " << minus << endl;

    return 0;
}
here this programme will not give expected answers as inout is taken after and operation is
done before
_________________________________________________________________________.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    char input, alphabet='A';
    alphabet++;
    cout<<alphabet;
    return 0;
}
Out put of this is B.

Lecture 15 

1. What do you mean by return 0
it means that program is executed successfully 




____________________________________________________________________________________

  int num1, num2;
    cout << "Enter nums ";
    cin >> num1, num2;
What is mistake in above???
It should be cin>>num1>>num2;

________________________________________
# note that x%y is only used for integers
it is pronounced as x modulus y and not x percentage y
_______________________________________________
We use a getch() function in a C/ C++ program to hold the output screen for some time until the 
user passes a key from the keyboard to exit the console screen. Using getch() function,
 we can hide the input character provided by the users in the ATM PIN, password, etc. Syntax: int getch(void);
_________________________________________________________________________________________ 


The isalpha() function checks whether the character entered is an alphabet or not. If it is not, it prints an error message.
char c;

if (!isalpha(c))
      printf("Error! Non-alphabetic character.");
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Statement: a logical unit of instruction/command
Program : declarations and one or more statements
assignment statement
selection statement
repetitive statements
function calls etc.
All statements are terminated by semicolon ( ; )
Note: In C, semi-colon is a statement terminator
rather than a separator!

# tut 22

c++ initially called as C with classes by stroustroup
class extension of structures (in C)

You can declareobjuests along with the class declaration like this:
class employee{
 class defination 
} harry, mahesh, rohan;

_______________________________________________________

#Tut 22
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string s;
    int i=3;

    cin>> s;
    cout<<s.at(1); 
    cout<<s.at(2); 
    cout<<s.at(3); 

    return 0;
}

note that st function is string function which will give what is at that point
say at(1) they it will print what number/ charcter at position 2 of string 
coz the number reading of cpp starts from 0



Note --> while taking multiple inputs from scanf don't give a space at end 
like scanf("%d %d") use this
scanf("%d %d ") dont use this as it will promt for another input or I don know  

_______________________________________________________________________________

Note if the addresss is like 0x61fe08 this is address in hexa decimal format 
hexadecimal format consits of 16 characters.10 numbers and 6 letters

 we can use priintf in c++ video number 67 c++ cwh

vey very important 
 swap by pointers -->void swapointer(int *a, int *b);
                                     swapointer(&x, &y); // function callling 
swap by reference --> swapref(int&a, int&b)
		 swapref(x,y);              // function calling 
______________________________________________________________
note swap function is already available in c++ so dont use it
