1.Usually used in dynamic graphs, where configuration of graphs is changing. 
2. gives you two functions - find parents and union 

Time complexity 
 for union it's O(4*alpha) which is equivalent to constant time 
 for find parent -> same as above 
 

Why connect smaller to larger? 
To reduce travel time. 
Say you have two graphs of length 4 and 2. 
if you connect 4 wala to head of 2, the path find time for all nodes in 4 wala increase by one 
in opposite case if you connect 2 wala to 4, time will increase but only of 2 nodes while in previous case it was increasing for 4 nodes. 
Thus you should connect smaller to bigger one. 

UNION By Size 
IN union by rank we had rand and parents arrays. 
Here we are having size and parents array where size of each node at start = 1;
