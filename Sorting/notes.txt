********** Analysis criterial for  Sorting Algorithm ******************

1. Time complexity 
2. Space complexity - The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size
  -> Inplace sorting algorithm - Constant memory usagae, not growing with size 
                                Mostly swaping, rearranging Algorithms
3. Stability
4. Internal vs External sorting algo 
    -> Internal - All data loaded in memory
    -> External - All data not loaded in memory 
5. Adaptive - The sorting algorithms in which the order of elements affects the time complexity of the sorting algorithm
             Aleady sorted data takes less time 
6. Recursive or not Recursive 


************** Bubble sort ****************************

1. Output - increasing order 
2.  Draw diagram 
3. By doing first pass/iteration of Bubble sort , we get largetst element at end. 
4. So in second iteration , we won't consider comparing last two elements as largetst element is already at end. 
5. Same goes for third iteration 
5. Thus for every pass/ iteration we having less pairs to compare. 
5. The second loop in bubble sort goes from 0 to n - i -1
6. For array of size n -> total comparisons are[(n-1), (n-2), (n-3),... 1 ] =  n(n-1)/2 thus O(n^2)
7. As order is retained thus bubble sort is stable Algorithm. 
8. Not a Recursive. 
9. Not Adaptive - as even for already sorted algorithm it will perform same number of swapings 
10. Inplace algorithm
10. But it can be make into Adaptive O(n).
11. Why Bubble sort ->  Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.
    and heavier elements tends to sink at bottom same here, larger numbers tends place at end 
12. use of bubble sort. 
    Easy to understand - sorting can be started from this - and small system - small fixed data then useful 
13. Try Recursive approach of bubble sort 


***************** Insertion sort ******************************
1. First loop in insertion sort starts from i = 1; 
2. Total passes = n-1
2. For array of size n -> total comparisons are n(n-1)/2 thus O(n^2)
3. In case of sorted array total comparisons are (n-1) so O(n) ( best case)
4. So it is adaptive and for already sorte array it will do less comparisons. 
5. Stable. Maintains order. 
6. No useful intermediate results. Like in bubble sort , after first pass we can say that largest element will be 
   at the end but we can't say such in insertion sort. 
7. By nature adaptive. No extra mehnat. 




***************** Selection sort *******************************
1. Total number of comparisons -same - n(n-1)/2
2. Selection sort is not stable. doesn't maintain order 
    eg. Input : 4A 5 3 2 4B 1
    Output : 1 2 3 4B 4A 5
3. Selection sort can be made stable if we shift the elements instaed of swaping them 
4. Selection sort as name suggest it selects the element and put it at it's appropriate location in sorted array. 


****************** Quick Sort ***********************************

1. In quick sort we chose a pivot element and make sure that that pivot element finally ends up in 
 position such that all elements left to it are less than pivot while all elements left to it are bigger than pivot. 
 1. So after the first pass , when right has crossed left. We have all the numbers smaller than pivot to left of crossing poing, 
 and greater than pivot on right side of crossing poing. 
 2. This means the pivot element is at it's final sorted postion now. We don't need to move it. 
 3. quick sort works on divide and conquer concept - once asked in test. 
 4. At the end of the day we are picking the pivot and placing it at it's right place - so choosing the pivot does not matter 
 5. How to find partition index - so we will have two pointer i and j. I starting from beginning of array and j 
 from end of array. When j found element which is smaller than pivot - but if this happend after i has crossed j 
 this means j has already reached other territory. and j is standing on the pivot point. 
 6. Also, here we are not creating any new arrays. We are using two pointers to work with section of array
 
 
 ************************* Merge sort ****************************** 
 
 1. Recursive Procedure , divide and conquer procedure 
 2. how to time is nlogn - https://youtu.be/mB5HXBb_HY8?feature=shared&t=654 
 	basically for every level we need 'n' time and there are log(n) levels so nlogn
